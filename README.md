# Code-Refactor-Challenge-1-
First Challenge for bootcamp. Refactoring code on webpage. 
# <Code-Refactor-Challenge-1 >

## Description


This project edited existing code for a webpage that functionted properly, but made it more descriptive and friendly for other coders. This including changing semantic elements in the HTML, adding alt descriptions for images in the HTML, and adding connotations in the CSS to help understand the function. This allows people who read the code to better understand what each part of the code represents, and also helps with users with visual impairments to understand what the images onscreen are.
